# PythonSoft folder Readme.

## What is this?

This is `software/PythonSoft` which contains all of the Python code for this repository. A variety of programs are sorted with various folders, such as Utilities being Utilities and Games being Games. 

## Who is Okmeque1?

I'm Okmeque1, a lone coder who started Python coding in ~early 2022. My first programs were simple program that did nothing more but make me learn the language in the folder, and were not that good, with bad variable names, no error handling and would only work on my machines due to the parameters that I set myself. I continued to evolve the programs until now, where I am today, using physical and internet help.

## What does he write?

I write whatever comes to my mind as an idea, from trying to recreate Windows 98 Setup to actually useful things like a password checker. So from that, don't ask me what you want me to do, you're just wasting my and your time.

## How to change the code?

**NEVER** commit to the main branch, as the only other copy I have that is up to date is on my drive. Make a *Pull request* instead, located under the word `software` for most computers. This will be reviewed within a weeks time and might be discussed about the change. If your code is terrible, it will be rejected. A pull request is a way for you to propose changes, without the main branch(where people will download stuff) being broken. 

## Some stuff to know

## Required Librairies

Librairies are basically add-ons for python programs. Say you wanted a GUI for a given program. Then you must install the module 'tkinter'. 

To install a module, navigate to the folder where PYTHON.EXE is located. To do this, press the Windows button then start typing 'Python'. You should see 'PYTHON.EXE' or 'Python' with the word 'app'. Right click, then open file location. Copy the file location into a command prompt as pip(module installer) only works in a command line. You will then run the command from the python location 'cd Scripts'. You have now changed directory. Then to install, run 'pip install {module}'. Keep in mind this does need an internet connection!

For all programs to function, you must have : 

1 : RANDOM


2 : TIME


3 : OpenCV(2)


4 : Cryptography


5 : OS


6 : tKinter


7 : Python Turtle graphics


8 : PyQT 5 - Windows 7 Compatible


9 : PSUTIL


10 : REQUESTS


11 : GETPASS


12 : HashLib
